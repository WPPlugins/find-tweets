== Description ==

== Changelog ==

= 0.11 =
* Added default goog.le shortening. Previously, if no shortlinking service was enabled (Jetpack etc), would only return example.com?p=123.
* Changed sentence recognition to recognize trailing space. Should fix some number issues such as (2.5). 

= 0.1 =
* Initial release.

== Upgrade Notice ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Sometimes puntuation will throw this tool off. Is there a planned fix for this =
Yes, right now the plugin only looks for periods, which when combined inside quotations or parentheses can generate unusual tweets. This will be fixed in future versions. 

= Are there planned added functionalities to this tool? =
Yes, I am hoping to eventually hook this up to Buffer's API.
